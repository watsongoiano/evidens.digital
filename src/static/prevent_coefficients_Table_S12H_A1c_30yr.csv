"*Beta coefficients can be interpreted as log odds ratios.  The dependent variable is the log-odds of the risk (log of risk /(1-risk)). Continous variables were centered at age 55, non-HDL-C 3.5, HDL-C 1.3, SBP 130, BMI 25, eGFR 90, ACR 1. Categorical variables used a value of 0 for no DM,  non-smoker, and no medication as the reference group. Therefore, the constant (intercept) applies to an individual with all of the values listed in this footnote. Appendix 4 provides the details of the computation, including the algebra for creating piece-wise linear splines (SBP, BMI, and eGFR).  Cholesterol (TC, HDL and calculated non-HDL-C) is converted to mmol/L from mg/dl by multiplying by 0.02586.  eGFR is calculated from serum creatinine using the CKD-EPI race free equation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
